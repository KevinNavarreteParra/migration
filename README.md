The goal of migration is to quickly and easily migrate all your R packages from one computer to another. 

## Installation

You can install the development version of migration like so:

``` r
# FILL THIS IN! HOW CAN PEOPLE INSTALL YOUR DEV PACKAGE?
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(migration)
get_packages("package_list.txt")
```

You would first run `get_packages` on your original computer to retreive a list of your user-installed packages.
